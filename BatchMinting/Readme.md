## Batch-Minting Support: We need to add support for both On-Chain and Off-Chain batch minting.

### Implementation of Off-chain batch minting: 

- We can optimize storage services by using efficient data structures and algorithms. By optimizing storage services, we can reduce the time and cost required to access and manipulate data.

- Defining or importing a MerkleTree class or library that supports the creation of Merkle trees, root calculation, and proof generation.

- Splitting the token data into batches, ensuring that each batch contains a manageable number of tokens (determined by batchSize).

- Making sure it includes the necessary functions (setMerkleRoot and batchMintNFTs) to support off-chain minting. 

- Using the contract object to interact with the smart contract, storing calculated Merkle roots and minting tokens in batches.

- At the end, thoroughly test the off-chain minting process in a test environment to ensure correctness and efficiency.

### Implementation of On-chain batch minting: 

- Using a Merkle tree to verify the token data's validity can reduce the transaction's gas cost and speed up the batch minting process.

- Define a TokenData struct to represent the essential data associated with each token, such as its ID, name, and owner.

- Implement or import a Merkle tree library to efficiently handle the creation of Merkle trees, root calculation, and proof generation.
- Set up a solidity contract with a mapping (tokenData) to store token data using the token ID as the key.
- Implement functions such as addTokenData to add new token data to the mapping, setMerkleRoot to set the Merkle root on-chain, and verifyTokenData to verify the 
 validity of token data using a Merkle proof.

- Include a generic verifyMerkleProof function to handle the verification of Merkle proofs, ensuring a gas-efficient and secure on-chain batch minting process.

- At the end, ensure that the contract handles various scenarios, including adding token data, setting the Merkle root, and verifying token data using Merkle proofs.
